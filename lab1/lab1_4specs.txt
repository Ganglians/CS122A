When A is 00000011, then B would scroll two LEDs next to each other from outside of B0 to oustide of B7.

When A is 00001001, then B would scroll two LEDs with two off LEDs in-between from outside of B7 to 

outside of B0.

When A is 00111001, then B would flash 00111001, invert the bits, mirror the first set of bits, an then 
invert that new set before repeating from the beginning.

When none of the conditions are satisfied, then two LEDs will start from the end (10000001) and move 

until they meet (00011000), before going back to the edge to repeat the loop.

Everything changes every half-second!
