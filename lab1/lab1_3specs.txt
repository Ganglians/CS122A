Two kinds of inverses

First state machine outputs a pattern of 01010101
Second state machine outputs a pattern of 10101010

Both run concurrently and take turns outputting (ex. state machine 1 outputs, then state machine 2, then back to
state machine 1, and so on) and do not interrupt each other (i.e. they wait for the other one to be done).

If A0 is 1 they both wait and no LEDs are on
If A0 goes back to being 0, then state machine 1 starts the cycle of aternation
